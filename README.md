My Final project - Todd Jollo
Focus on functionality not visuals. To my detriment, fall on my sword.

This project calls one function every time you hit the button.
<br/>
<br/>
That function has 2 jobs:<br/>
* increment the index <br/>
* call a function with the magic
<br/><br/>
The function with the magic has:<br/>
* loop through the numbers<br/>
* place in array of highest value<br/>
* if the next number in the order is lower then store the value of that number in variable<br/>
* at the end grab the number and splice it into the appropriate place in the array<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, and this ends a long Month.
